# data-analysis-01

This repository contains a Python script for comprehensive data analysis and visualization.

Description

The data_analysis.py script performs the following steps:

Loads a dataset (data.csv).
Explores the data using statistics, missing value handling, and duplicates removal.
Conducts Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) including correlation matrix, univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis.
Generates various visualizations such as histograms, boxplots, count plots, scatter plots, and pairplots.
Saves visualizations and cleaned dataset.
Dataset

The dataset used is data.csv.xls. Ensure you upload this file to the repository.
